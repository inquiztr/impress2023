                                        I wander into this store last week and
                                        had the most amazing experience. I loved
                                        the items sold and the energy in the
                                        store was magical. Lydia, offered a few
                                        ideas that resonated with me and I left
                                        feeling happy with what I bought. Funny
                                        thing is I wasn&apos;t looking for any
                                        particular gifts. I would highly
                                        recommend visiting the store, you
                                        won&apos;t be disappointed.

                                        I'm in love with this little shop!
                                        It&apos;s a great place to find anything
                                        and everything. The owner is friendly
                                        and very sociable and I love the
                                        atmosphere. Each time I go there&apos;s
                                        always something different. The layout
                                        of the shop is cute and comfortable too.
                                        Impressionable Gifts is the place to go
                                        if you&apos;re looking for something
                                        unique and special.
